		JVL Labs is committed to protecting user privacy online. We believe that strong electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet. At JVL, we pledge to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. We will not disclose individually identifiable information about you to any third party without your consent.

		<h2><br>Information We Collect</h2>
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><br>IP Address</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		The JVL Web site logs IP addresses for system administration purposes. Your IP address can help us diagnose problems with our server and track a user's session to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. In addition, we track system information, such as the type of browser you are using, your operating system, and the referring IP address. We use this information in aggregate only; we do not link IP addresses to any personal identifiers.
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><br>Cookies</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		JVL uses a feature of your browser called a cookie to store your member ID and state information about where you are in the site. JVL uses cookies to keep track of where you are in the site since the Internet is a stateless environment, but many of JVL's functions, such as moving from one page to the next, require state. JVL does not store any of your personal information in cookies. A cookie is simply a small data file that the Web site writes to your hard drive. A cookie can't read any other data off your hard drive, pass on a virus, or read cookie files created by other sites. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. JVL will not operate properly without cookies enabled.

		<b><br>Registration</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		A significant amount of the site is available without registration, but in order to take advantage of some features of JVL web site, you must register and create an account. The JVL online registration form requires you to provide your full name, email address, ZIP code, a User Name, and password. All other registration information, such as your age, address, phone number, and employer, is optional and is marked as such. We hope that, like many JVL web users, you will want to provide information about yourself so that we can continue to make our Web site more valuable to you. For certain contests, surveys, or chat forums, we may ask you to provide additional information about yourself. Participation in these enhanced services is completely optional.

		<b><br>Usage</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		As you interact with JVL, your usage patterns are logged anonymously. This tells us if you searched to find information and what searches you used.
